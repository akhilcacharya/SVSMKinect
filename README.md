#AirSwimmers Control Kit

This application was developed by a partnership of Sean Freemerman (Bitbucket thefreemerman) and I as part of Summer Ventures 2013 at Appalachian State University under the tutelage of Rahman Tashakkori. 

A research paper regarding the application was awarded the top prize at Summer Ventures 2013, allowing Sean and I to present and publish our research as part of the [State of North Carolina Undergraduate Research Symposium](http://www.sncurcs.org/). 

##Purpose

The purpose of the application is to behave as an intermediary between an off-the shelf first generation Kinect Sensor and an infrared transmitter. Using the open source software package WinLIRC, the Kinect can be used to control remote IR devices. In our case, we used a cheap AirSwimmer balloon.

##Abstract

*This paper details how a Microsoft Kinect Sensor can be utilized to control an AirSwimmer, a commercially available infrared-controlled indoor blimp. To facilitate this control, an application was developed to accept Kinect human position data from a collection of skeleton joints and transmit them as representation of simple commands to an IR transmitter. The application is written in the C# using Microsoft’s Visual Studio Development Environment. The application interfaces with WinLIRC, a Windows application used to send serial data to specific infrared transmitters. The authors expanded on an example application by Microsoft as the base to provide a customized user-interface for debugging purposes. Despite challenges in infrared transmission, eventually a working prototype was created that successfully received commands from a Kinect. This experiment illustrated that the developed application was a viable method of controlling the AirSwimmer, and by extension, other infrared devices with the user’s body. The project provided a valuable experience in working with C# and the Kinect Software Development Kit as well as several software engineering practices used in the industry. Lessons learned from this endeavor were then used to develop general-use control systems for other remote devices and computer systems.*
